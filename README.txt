dtwco - implementation of constrained DTW algorithms in python.
===============================================================

Note that this code is based on [`mlpy`](http://mlpy.sourceforge.net) implementation of DTW and thus is released at the same
GPL-3.0 license as `mlpy`.

Originally this code was shipped with a distribution of `mlpy`, however this project seems to be
dead and I think people find it confusing the purpose of this repository.
As of August 2017 it was therefore decided to split away the DTW code from `mlpy`.
